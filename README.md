# Jungle of Jewels 
to access source code go to assets then scripts 

A 3D third-person stealth game built in Unity as part of my final year project. The game explores how interactive storytelling techniques like audio cues, enemy dialogue, and environmental signposting can enhance player immersion.

## Features:
- Jewel collection and win condition
- Enemy patrols with FOV and detection bars
- Adaptive music (proximity and chase)
- Subtitle-driven dialogue and signposting
- Full UI system and modular scripting

All source code is included.
